The data set contains 5000 rows, with features containing gender, income, organization type, car owner, children count, family status, and type of loan.
The pdf named _Defaulter_ contains the plots with data for the "defaulters" and the pdf named _NotDefaulter_ contains the plots for the values which are "non-defaulters".
The file _OriginalFile_ is the power BI .pbix file

# Data Analysis (conclusions from the dataset)
- One can quickly see that although in the dataset, the population of non-defaulters that are female are very high compared to the male popuation, the number of defaulters are similar for both female and male. This shows that there males are more likely to default.
- People are more likely to default on cash loan payments than the revolving loan payments.
- People with income lower than the average incomes are more likely to default on their payments.
- People in working class are most likely to default on their payments than commmercial loaner, pensioners etc.
- Family status doesnot affect the credit card payment default.
